The Movie Seat Booking project is a web-based application focused solely on frontend development. It allows users to select and book movie seats through an interactive user interface. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project provides a visually appealing layout with dynamically generated seating arrangements.

The interface enables users to select available seats, visually distinguishing between selected, booked, and available options using color coding. JavaScript handles the seat selection logic, ensuring that users can only book available seats and calculate the total price based on the number of seats chosen. This project showcases a strong grasp of frontend development principles, including responsive design, interactive elements, and clean, organized code.
